#dotfiles
ViM dev environment config files


##Installation

**WARNING**: Some of these configurations are intended for my personal use, it may
conflict with some settings already configured on your system. Tread lightly.

Change to your home directory `cd ~`

then `git clone https://github.com/apeduru/dotfiles.git`

`cd dotfiles`

execute `bash install.sh`

##Mappings

*NOTE*: These are what work best for me. YMMV

<kbd>F2</kbd> to toggle NERD Tree, a source directory to easily manage files
(see nerd.vim for more details)

<kbd>F3</kbd> to toggle paste (Insert & Visual modes)


<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 6 will allow you to switch between buffers
